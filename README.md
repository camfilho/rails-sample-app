# Ruby on Rails Tutorial Sample Application

This is the sample application for [*Ruby on Rails Tutoria:](www.google.com)

# Getting Started
 To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
 $ bundle install --without production
 ```

 Next, migrate the database:

 ```
 $ rails db:migrate
 ```

 Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

 ```
 $ rails test
 ```

 If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server

 ```
 $ rails server
 ```
